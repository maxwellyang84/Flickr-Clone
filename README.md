***Flickr Clone***

This project is a mobile application intended to clone the popular image sharing app, Flickr.

The project was tasked to us by our employers as a training application to fine-tune our skills in Android Studio.

For this project, we utilized Google Firebase as our database for storing user information, with authentication/authorization, image storing and realtime features all implemented using Firebase APIs.
